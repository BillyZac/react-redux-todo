#Play Nine

A tiny game demonstrating the basics of React.js.

## Status
I made this game in [Plunkr](http://embed.plnkr.co/YjJMHTQhvi5O2F89L1BB/), following a [tutorial on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents) and I'm now rebuilding based on [Atomic Design principles](http://patternlab.io/about.html) with Gulp/Babel coolness.

I'm using the [React/Atomic Good Start](https://bitbucket.org/ZacSmith777/react-atomic-goodstart/src) as an example.

So far, the `gulp build` is working


The app itself is at the Hello World stage, but the basic modular structure is in place.

## Usage
```
$ npm install
$ gulp build
$ cd dist
$ http-server # Make sure this is globally installed first.
```
